## Ways to Contribute

There are a number of ways you can contribute to the project. The major two are:

- Submitting a GitHub issue. This could involve:
    - Logging a bug or undesirable behaviour
    - Recording area of possible improvement
    - Requesting a change or addition of a new feature

- Contributing code. Our work is never done, if you have an idea how you could make Gelato better or if you think you
could generalise it:
    - You can outline the new feature or desired behaviour in a GitHub issue
    - Please follow advice below on Contributing Code, working in a branch and the Pull Request process.
    - You may continue to, and are encouraged to, keep in touch and reach out to us throughout your development work.

See this helpful site on [How to Contribute to Open Source](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/) for more ideas
on how you could contribute.


## Submitting Issues

See the guidance on [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-an-issue) to
learn how to submit an  issue.

If you have an idea for a new feature for Gelato or a record of a
bug you can communicate this to us in detail through a written account as a GitHub issue on Gelato's
[issues page](https://github.com/arup-group/gelato/issues).

A good feature request issue outlines the problem in a full written format. Include why you think the
new feature would be useful, what problem it would solve and any real-world examples that would
benefit from this improvement.

For bug reports, please provide the full error message, the OS and information about the environment in which the
process ran. If possible, provide set of data on which the problem can be recreated.



## Contributing Code - Pull Request Process

To find beginner-friendly issues you may want to work on, look [here](https://github.com/arup-group/gelato/contribute).

1. All new work is done in a branch taken from `main`, details can be found here:
[feature branch workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow)

2. Ensure your work is covered by unit tests to the required percentage level.

3. Submit your Pull Request (see [GitHub Docs on Creating a Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request)),
describing the feature, link to any relevant GitHub issues and request review from at
least two developers. (Take a look at latest commits to find out which developers you should request review from)

4. You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of two reviewers, or if you
do not have permission to do merge, request one of the reviewers to merge it for you.
