Gelato is a [MATSim](https://github.com/matsim-org/matsim-libs/tree/master#readme)-flavoured reference implementation
of the transport Key Performance Indicators (KPI) framework described at
[insert link to KPI framework blog post/other](). Gelato exists to provide a runnable application with which to better
understand and explore the framework, and as such, should be regarded as a by-product of the framework rather
than a work in its own right.

The KPI metrics generated by Gelato provide a snapshot summary of a
given MATSim model, and help compare different MATSim models and scenarios against each other.


# Installation

If you have Docker installed and would prefer to use Gelato via Docker rather than
locally installing the prerequisite dependencies and building and running the Java
application from the command line, skip to the
"[Using Gelato via Docker](#using-gelato-via-docker)" section.

Alternatively, you can grab the latest pre-built, runnable Gelato jar file from the
[releases page](https://github.com/arup-group/gelato/releases), make sure you have the necessary
[prerequisites](#prerequisites) installed and then skip straight to the "[Usage](#usage)" section.

To find out how to build Gelato from source and then run it without using Docker, read on...

## Prerequisites
In order to build and run Gelato locally, your environment must already have available:

#### JDK >= 17
- Start [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) or [here](https://jdk.java.net/)
- If you want to run Gelato from a pre-built jar file rather than build it yourself, you can install a JRE
rather than a full JDK

#### Maven
- Start [here](https://maven.apache.org/)
- Only required if you're building Gelato from source

## Building
To compile everything, run all unit tests and linting checks, and build a runnable jar file that includes all
the necessary dependencies, clone this repo, and then from the directory you cloned it into:

```shell
mvn clean package
```

This will generate a new jar file in the `target` directory that is named according to the Gelato
version number and the latest git commit level - `gelato-0.0.1-alpha-with-dependencies-230f897.jar`
is the runnable jar in the example below:

```shell
ls -talh target
```

```

# Usage

You can run Gelato from the command line, directly from the jar file. The CLI is quite discoverable:

```shell
java -jar target/gelato-0.0.1-alpha-with-dependencies-230f897.jar --help
```

```
Usage: MatsimKpiGenerator [-hV] -mc=<matsimConfigFile>
                          -mo=<matsimOutputDirectory> -o=<outputDir>

  -h, --help        Show this help message and exit.
  -mc=<matsimConfigFile>
                    Full path to your model's MATSim config file
  -mo=<matsimOutputDirectory>
                    Full path to your model's MATSim output directory
  -o=<outputDir>    Full path to the directory you want KPIs to be written to
  -V, --version     Print version information and exit.
```

To generate KPI metrics in a local directory on your machine, assuming:

- MATSim output directory is at `/path/to/my-model/outputs`
- MATSim config file at `/path/to/my-model/outputs/output_config.xml`
- Target output directory at `/path/to/gelato-outputs/my-model/kpi`

```shell
java -jar target/gelato-0.0.1-alpha-with-dependencies-230f897.jar \
-mc /path/to/my-model/outputs/output_config.xml \
-mo /path/to/my-model/outputs \
-o /path/to/gelato-outputs/my-model/kpi
```

We recommend using MATSim's output config file for the `-mc` parameter wherever
possible.

Gelato will read in MATSim's output files and generate a number of compressed output
files in the directory you specified via `-o`, giving you something like this:

comprehensive description, see [insert blog post link here]().

## A word about memory
Gelato is a memory-hungry application. The bigger the model outputs you feed it in
terms of the size of the events file, the network file, etc., the more memory it will need.
For this reason, for some MATSim models you will need to:

- Run Gelato in an environment with a lot of RAM available (memory usage of over 100GB is not unheard of)
- Tweak [the JVM heap settings](https://bell-sw.com/blog/guide-to-jvm-memory-configuration-options/) to make
sure that Gelato is able to use as much of the available RAM as possible

Gelato logs its memory usage every minute, like so:
```shell
2024-02-12T13:34:03,345  INFO MemoryObserver:42 used RAM: 25 MB  free: 518 MB  total: 544 MB
2024-02-12T13:35:03,350  INFO MemoryObserver:42 used RAM: 6167 MB  free: 9304 MB  total: 15472 MB
2024-02-12T13:36:03,351  INFO MemoryObserver:42 used RAM: 9854 MB  free: 9585 MB  total: 19440 MB
2024-02-12T13:37:03,358  INFO MemoryObserver:42 used RAM: 15375 MB  free: 5568 MB  total: 20944 MB
2024-02-12T13:38:03,365  INFO MemoryObserver:42 used RAM: 21976 MB  free: 3623 MB  total: 25600 MB
2024-02-12T13:39:03,372  INFO MemoryObserver:42 used RAM: 25378 MB  free: 221 MB  total: 25600 MB
2024-02-12T13:40:03,374  INFO MemoryObserver:42 used RAM: 22115 MB  free: 3484 MB  total: 25600 MB
2024-02-12T13:41:03,379  INFO MemoryObserver:42 used RAM: 23096 MB  free: 2503 MB  total: 25600 MB
2024-02-12T13:42:03,385  INFO MemoryObserver:42 used RAM: 22929 MB  free: 2670 MB  total: 25600 MB
2024-02-12T13:43:03,392  INFO MemoryObserver:42 used RAM: 24238 MB  free: 1361 MB  total: 25600 MB
2024-02-12T13:44:03,402  INFO MemoryObserver:42 used RAM: 23718 MB  free: 1881 MB  total: 25600 MB
2024-02-12T13:45:03,409  INFO MemoryObserver:42 used RAM: 23552 MB  free: 2047 MB  total: 25600 MB
```

If you're running on a machine with 120GB of RAM, you may be surprised to see Gelato
fail with an out of memory error having used around only 30GB of RAM. This is because the JVM's
[`MaxRAMPercentage`](https://www.baeldung.com/java-jvm-parameters-rampercentage#-xxmaxrampercentage)
setting defaults to 25%, so 75% of the available RAM will go ignored and unused. You can override this
default behaviour in a number of different ways using JVM parameters, for example:

- Use `Xmx` to set the max heap size to an absolute value, for example 100GB:
```shell
java -Xmx100g \
-jar gelato-0.0.2-alpha.jar \
-mc /path/to/my-model/outputs/output_config.xml \
-mo /path/to/my-model/outputs \
-o /path/to/gelato-outputs/my-model/kpi
```
- Use `MaxRAMPercentage` to set the max heap size as a percentage of the available RAM (values *must*
include 1 decimal place, so `80.0` rather than `80`):
```shell
java -XX:MaxRAMPercentage=80.0 \
-jar gelato-0.0.2-alpha.jar \
-mc /path/to/my-model/outputs/output_config.xml \
-mo /path/to/my-model/outputs \
-o /p
```

## A word about running times
We have not yet spent any time trying to optimise runtime. Running times depend on a combination of factors,
but are mostly influenced by:

- The size and shape of the MATSim outputs you feed to Gelato
- The specifications of the machine you are running Gelato on

For this reason, Your Mileage May (Will..) Vary, but as an example, on an M2 Macbook Pro, a full set of
KPIs takes between 22 and 36 minutes to generate for a model with a compressed events file
of around 620MB, containing 61.4 million events, and a full set of input files like this:

```shell
-rw-r--r--@ 1 mickyfitz  staff    29M 26 Jan 15:41 output_vehicles.xml.gz
-rw-r--r--@ 1 mickyfitz  staff    45M 26 Jan 15:41 output_trips.csv.gz
-rw-r--r--@ 1 mickyfitz  staff    38K 26 Jan 15:39 output_transitVehicles.xml.gz
-rw-r--r--@ 1 mickyfitz  staff   1.1M 26 Jan 15:39 output_transitSchedule.xml.gz
-rw-r--r--@ 1 mickyfitz  staff   469M 26 Jan 15:39 output_plans.xml.gz
-rw-r--r--@ 1 mickyfitz  staff    17M 26 Jan 15:28 output_persons.csv.gz
-rw-r--r--@ 1 mickyfitz  staff   906K 26 Jan 15:27 output_network.xml.gz

-rw-r--r--@ 1 mickyfitz  staff   205M 26 Jan 15:26 output_experienced_plans.xml.gz
-rw-r--r--@ 1 mickyfitz  staff   618M 26 Jan 15:20 output_events.xml.gz
-rw-r--r--@ 1 mickyfitz  staff   194B 26 Jan 15:05 output_counts.xml.gz
-rw-r--r--@ 1 mickyfitz  staff    18K 26 Jan 15:05 output_config_reduced.xml
-rw-r--r--@ 1 mickyfitz  staff    53K 26 Jan 15:05 output_config.xml
-rw-r--r--@ 1 mickyfitz  staff   2.1M 26 Jan 15:05 output_allVehicles.xml.gz
-rw-r--r--@ 1 mickyfitz  staff    32M 26 Jan 15:05 output_activities.csv.gz
```

Peak memory usage was around 20GB - see the [memory settings](#a-word-about-memory) section for a deeper
discussion of memory usage and JVM settings.


# Using Gelato via Docker

## Building the Image
You can build a Gelato Docker image by cloning this repo, and then running the
following command from the directory you cloned it into:

```shell
docker build -t gelato .
```

We have tried to keep the Docker image size reasonably small (around 350MB).

## Running Gelato via the Image
Assuming:

- A MATSim output directory on your local machine at `/path/to/my-model/outputs`
- A MATSim config file on your local machine at `/path/to/my-model/outputs/output_config.xml`
- A target KPI output directory on your local machine at `/path/to/gelato-outputs/my-model`
- A desired path to the MATSim files directory inside the Docker container of `/my-model-outputs`
- A desired path to the Gelato KPI output directory inside the Docker container of `/gelato-out`

You can run Gelato from the Docker image you just built by mounting
the input and output data directories as [volumes](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/) in the Docker container
via a command like this:

```shell
docker run \
-v /path/to/my-model/outputs/:/my-model-outputs \
-v /path/to/gelato-outputs/my-model:/gelato-out \
gelato \
-mc /my-model-outputs/output_config.xml \
-mo /my-model-outputs \
-o /gelato-out
```

You can use Gelato's CLI in essentially the same way you would when running directly from the jar file, for example:

```shell
docker run gelato --version
```
```
0.0.1-alpha
```

```shell
docker run gelato --help
```

```
Usage: MatsimKpiGenerator [-hV] -mc=<matsimConfigFile>
                          -mo=<matsimOutputDirectory> -o=<outputDir>
  -h, --help        Show this help message and exit.
  -mc=<matsimConfigFile>
                    Full path to your model's MATSim config file
  -mo=<matsimOutputDirectory>
                    Full path to your model's MATSim output directory
  -o=<outputDir>    Full path to the directory you want KPIs to be written to
  -V, --version     Print version information and exit.
```

## Configuring JVM memory settings in the Docker container
JVMs have been "container-aware" for a few years now, meaning they can detect when they are running
inside a container and read Cgroup settings. This means that JVM memory settings are based on the memory
available **to the container**, rather than the memory available in the host environment. This is welcome
behaviour when running Gelato via Docker, but you will usually still need to tweak the JVM settings to
make full use of containers with large amounts of RAM.

You can do this using the same JVM parameters described in the [JVM memory](#a-word-about-memory)
section above, but passing these parameters into the Docker container requires you to set a `JVM_OPTS`
environmental variable to hold all the param name/value pairs. Your Docker `run` command would therefore
look something like this:

```shell
docker run \
-v /path/to/my-model/outputs/:/my-model-outputs \
-v /path/to/gelato-outputs/my-model:/gelato-out \
-e JVM_OPTS="-Xmx100G -XX:+PrintFlagsFinal" \
gelato \
-mc /my-model-outputs/output_config.xml \
-mo /my-model-outputs \
-o /gelato-out
```

(The `-XX:+PrintFlagsFinal` param does not modify memory configuration, but instructs the JVM to dump all of
its settings to the console on startup. That can be handy when you want to confirm that the memory settings
are as you expect.)


# The KPIs

## Methodology
Much of the work that led to the creation of Gelato involved defining
[a framework of useful KPIs (link to blog post here)]() that can be calculated using data available from a MATSim
simulation. The KPIs are grouped together under "themes", strongly influenced by the
[World Business Council for Sustainable Development](https://www.wbcsd.org/) dimensions of
[sustainable mobility](https://docs.wbcsd.org/2015/03/Mobility_indicators.pdf) and the three pillars of
sustainable development. The themes that we use to describe our KPIs are outlined in column "KPI Theme".

| WBCSD Dimension of Sustainable Mobility | Sustainable Development Pillar | KPI Theme                     |
|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| "Global Environment"                    | "Environmental"                | "Environment"                 |
| "Quality of Life"                       | "Social"                       | "Social"                      |
| "Economic Success"                      | "Economic"                     | "Economic"                    |
| "Mobility System Performance"           | --                             | "Mobility System Performance" |

Spanning across all themes, a fourth dimension, "Mobility System Performance" is effectively a separate, unifying layer, whereby improvements in mobility system performance can lead to better outcomes across any or all of the other themes. 

Some KPIs do not fall directly under a specific theme, but are parameters
for generating other KPIs. They are marked as `Parameter` in the table
below. Parameters are included to provide context on the simulation and allow
for sense-checking, whereas KPIs are intended to allow for measurement of sustainable mobility and be compared across scenarios.

## The KPI Metrics
We will add more KPIs as we go, but for now, these are the KPIs generated by Gelato:

## Intermediate Data
Gelato generates a number of "intermediate" files that represent the intermediate, disaggregate output of
various KPI calculations:

## Supporting Data

In addition to KPI and intermediate files, Gelato also generates a number of "supporting data" files containing the
data aggregations used as inputs to the KPI calculations. These files allow the user to perform their own ad-hoc
analyses without having to parse and collate raw MATSim output data. Supporting data files use the naming scheme
`supporting-data-<name of aggregation>`.
