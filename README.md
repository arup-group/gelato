# Gelato (working title)

A command-line post-processing tool to turn MATSim ABM outputs into KPI metrics.

Gelato sits downstream of a [MATSim](https://github.com/matsim-org/matsim-libs/tree/master#readme) agent-based transport simulation and consumes outputs from the simulation. These outputs are used to generate Key Performance Indicator (KPI) metrics that measure and document the behaviour of the simulation.
